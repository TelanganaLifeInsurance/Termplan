          <h3>What are TLL investment plans</h3>
          <p class="lead">Its a unique investment instrument that seamlessly combines wealth creation and insurance in one product. 
		  With an Telangana first life policy, you get a tool to create a corpus of wealth while having the peace of mind that the 
		  same insurance plan covers your life. While you focus on putting money aside to meet your future needs, a TLL investment plan
		  works towards generating the returns you need..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">As compared to other investment plans, a TLL plan offers you the advantage of clubbing investment and insurance 
		  in one policy. When faced with life's certain uncertainties, a TLL insurance plan ensures that your family's future is protected 
		  in any eventuality.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Under a Unit Linked Insurance Plan, the premiums paid are spread out to cover your insurance and investment needs simultaneously.
		  A part of the premium goes towards the TLL insurance component to offer you life cover while the TLL plan is in force. The rest is invested in debt,
		  equity, or a combination of both in alignment with your long-term financial goals.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Depending on your life stage, you can use the corpus created by the IndiaFirst Life TLL investment plan to meet your retirement funding goals,
		  pay for your child's education, or invest in real estate. Whatever your financial needs may be, a TLL plan can be customised to get you what you want.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading"><a class="nostyle" name="investment-plan">TLL Investment Plan</a></h2>
          <h3>HOW DOES A TLL INVESTMENT PLAN WORK?</h3>
		  
          <p class="lead">Insurance savings plans offer dual benefits of insurance and savings. However, the returns from savings plans are moderate because they 
		  generally have a guaranteed component and are designed for risk-averse investors. Every guide to choose a TLL plan will tell you that a Unit-linked 
		  Insurance Plan offers market-linked returns. Since TLL plans invest in capital markets, such plans may offer higher returns than other non-linked plans, 
		  especially if you stay invested in the long run.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">When you buy TLL online, the insurer specifies the necessary details of the plan. These details include a death benefit, which is the 
		  amount that the beneficiary listed in your plan stands to receive in case of the policyholder's untimely demise during the tenure of the policy.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">In case the life assured completes the policy tenure, they receive maturity benefits. In TLLs, the maturity benefit is the corpus created 
		  by investing the premium payments in a mix of market-linked investment funds. As the investor, you can choose which funds you would like your money invested 
		  in—equity funds, debt funds, or a balanced combination of both.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Like mutual funds, when you buy TLL plan online, you are privy to a professional expert fund manager who invests all the TLL investment funds 
		  to get market-linked returns. These investment decisions are backed by sound financial research. Once you opt for a fund/s, you are allotted a certain number of 
		  units in that fund, depending on your premium amount and other preferences.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Based on the units of the investment fund, a Net Asset Value or NAV is arrived at. This NAV is assessed and declared by the insurer every day. 
		  The present-day NAV is translated into monetary value when the policy attains maturity, pay-outs need to be made, or partial withdrawals are sanctioned.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">A TLL may have many similarities with mutual funds, but it is also an insurance product. Irrespective of how the TLL investment does, 
		  a death benefit/sum assured is guaranteed when you buy TLL online or offline. Subject to policy provisions, this death benefit is owed to the nominee 
		  listed in the policy, ensuring that your loved ones' financial future would be secured in the case of an unfortunate event.</p>

          <h3>HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST TLL PLAN?</h3>
		  <h1><span style="color:#008B8B;">Shirin</span></h1>
		  
		  
          <p class="lead">In this short guide to choose TLL plan, learn how to buy TLL plan in a well-informed and systematic manner. 
		  When you decide to buy TLL plan online, here are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">A TLL plan is customisable, so you can choose exactly where your money will be invested. When you buy TLL online or offline, 
		  you are presented with a list of funds that invest in debt, equity, or a combined bag of both. The first step in any guide to choose TLL plan is 
		  to make sure you know your life goals and financial needs so you can buy TLL plan online in alignment with your needs</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Debt funds present the chance to earn moderate returns with relatively low risk. On the other hand, equity funds offer higher returns 
		  but also present a higher risk. You can also choose a balanced mix of both to spread out the risk.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">If you have a long-term financial goal that is likely to cost a substantial amount, such as your child's higher education fees, 
		  then an equity-heavy allocation may be prudent. If your financial goals include protecting the accumulated value of the funds saved to meet your retirement goals,
		  you will do better to invest in debt-oriented funds.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">With TLLs, you can choose which funds to invest in. You can either make this choice based on an in-depth evaluation of your life goals and 
		  risk-appetite or speak to a financial consultant to help you decide before you buy TLL online or want to switch between funds.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Besides the investment component, the other most crucial benefit is the life insurance coverage you opt for when you buy TLL plan online. 
		  This insurance coverage is your family's safety net in case of an unfortunate incident during the tenure of the policy. Not getting adequate life cover 
		  would be a waste of the benefits offered by TLLs.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">While the investment component will help you meet your wealth creation goals, the insurance component serves to ensure that your financial goals 
		  meet your family's needs even in your absence. When you buy TLL online, consider your financial objectives, your family's lifestyle, and then choose the 
		  sum assured that will support them if the need arises.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">One of the primary purposes of a TLL is wealth creation. To generate a substantial corpus, you have to let the power of compounding work on 
		  maximising your returns. Staying invested for an extended period is the way to do this. When you buy TLL plan online, a lock-in period of 5 years is intimated to you. 
		  Typically, a surrender value may be earned after 3 years, and partial withdrawals may be allowed after 5 years, depending on policy provisions. Opt for a longer tenure 
		  to build wealth for yourself and your family.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">It is pivotal that you invest your money with your eyes wide open so you know exactly what you will be getting into and what you stand to gain when you buy 
		  TLL plan online or offline. Insurers levy specific charges common to all TLLs under the headings of fund management fees, mortality charges, service charges, 
		  administration fees, premium allocation charges, discontinuation or surrender charges, etc.  Some insurers levy all of these charges, while others do not. 
		  Make a well-informed choice after considering the charges when you buy TLL online..</p>

          <h3>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF A TLL POLICY?</h3>
		  
          <p class="lead">TLLs are dynamic financial instruments that offer investors the dual benefits of investment and insurance. There are many TLL policy benefits 
		  that serve to bolster your investment portfolio. In the past, life insurance was mostly seen as an assurance or a guarantee, but not as an investment. 
		  To ensure your financial future, it is essential to get life insurance and to put your money to work by investing in the right financial instruments. 
		  The dual features of TLL plans meet both these needs and get you closer to lasting financial security.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">The investment component is one of the essential features of TLL plans. The money you invest in TLLs is diverted to several market-linked 
		  financial instruments so that you can gain the most TLL benefits from the policy. Along with creating a corpus of wealth, getting life insurance is another 
		  critical TLL plan benefit. The comprehensive life insurance coverage offered as TLL benefits give you the peace of mind that your life and your family's financial 
		  future are covered during the tenure of the policy.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">With a TLL plan, you have signed up for a unique financial instrument that offers you many TLL plan benefits. When a policyholder has paid regular 
		  premiums to keep the policy in force, they receive maturity TLL benefits upon surviving the tenure of the policy. At maturity, the policyholder gets the current value 
		  of the TLL fund along with loyalty additions and bonuses, if any are announced..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">In case of the policyholder's unfortunate demise during the tenure of the policy, the nominee/beneficiary listed in the policy receives the predetermined 
		  sum assured as death benefits of TLL policy. Depending on the benefits of the TLL policy chosen, you can ensure that the beneficiary gets the sum assured along with the 
		  fund's present-day value, or whichever amount is higher as TLL policy benefits..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">While everyone knows the importance of saving regularly, the truth is that most people do not divert the required amounts towards saving with the idea that 
		  it can be done later. Saving money, however much possible, regularly and consistently is the key to long-term financial security and success. One of the benefits of TLL policy 
		  is that it teaches the habit of saving regularly by putting away premium payments. Then, you can relax and reap the wealth creation benefits of TLL policy..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">The features of TLL plans allow for great flexibility and customisation, depending on your financial goals and needs. The flexibility of investment is 
		  one of the prime TLL policy benefits..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">With Fund Switch TLL plan benefits, you can choose how your money moves. In a TLL plan, a significant chunk of your premium is earmarked for investment
		  purposes. This money can be diverted towards low-risk debt funds, higher-risk equity funds, or a balanced mix of both.</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Depending on your chosen plan's TLL policy benefits, you can switch between fund types to get the most TLL benefits. Typically, you can make a fixed 
		  number of changes without an additional charge in a given financial year. You can refer to the TLL benefits in the policy document to understand whether your chosen 
		  plan offers to switch between funds for free..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Another investment flexibility offered as TLL benefits is the ability to redirect where a specific premium amount will go. Not only can you specify which 
		  funds you would like your premium to be redirected to, but you can also demarcate the percentage of the premium that you would like allocated to each fund of your choosing..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Every TLL policy is locked-in for a period of five years. While the lock-in period may seem limiting, it serves a particular function. At the start of the 
		  investment, the value of the funds is low, and it takes time for your fund value to increase. The lock-in period offers enough time for your TLL to grow and gives you substantial 
		  returns and TLL benefits. After the lock-in period ends, you can opt for partial withdrawal of your fund value to meet emergency needs..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Most TLL plans create space for future additions to the money already being invested, so you may be allowed to put in additional single premiums as 
		  and when you have the money to do so..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Seen over a long period of time, the trajectory of the market has always been upwards. With a TLL policy, you have the opportunity to make the most 
		  of this upward trajectory. You get to invest a portion of your money in market-linked debt or equity funds, depending on your risk appetite..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Everyone would like to get something extra in return for their investment. Besides regular TLL benefits, a TLL investment also offers chances to boost 
		  the wealth you have created in the form of fund boosters and loyalty additions. These additions are given to you as a reward for staying invested for an extended period of time.
		  At maturity, some TLL plans also provide a return of the mortality charges levied..</p>
		  
		  <p class="lead">Depending on the relevant tax conditions as specified by the Indian government, you may get some tax exemptions and TLL benefits under Section 80C and 10(10D) 
		  of the Income Tax Act of 1961. These TLL benefits are subject to the provisions made under the IT Act and may be amended periodically.</p>
